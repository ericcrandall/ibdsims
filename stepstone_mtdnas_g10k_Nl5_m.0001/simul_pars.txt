Random Seeds : 14071789
nbr of simulated samples : 100 dataset(s) x 1 locus = 100
generic data file name: stepstone_mtdna_
Lattice with absorbing boundaries
nbr of loci per sample file (n_locus): 1
Postdisp Sample: nbr of sampled nodes (dim_sample1 X dim_sample2): 10 x 1
Postdisp sample: nbr of sampled individuals per sampled node (IndPerPopSampled): 20
Postdisp sample: x/y coordinate of "first" (bottom left) sampled node (xmin_sample/ymin_sample): 1/1

==============
Mutation model(s) (if multiple markers/loci have been specified, only the first locus of each marker is mentioned below):

HKY85 Mutation rate (mu) is constant for this marker : 5e-05
==============

Demographic phase: 0
At G=0 (sampling time ==  present) : 
lattice dimensions are (LatticeSizeX * LatticeSizeY): 10 x 1
Haploid individuals : nbr of genes per lattice node (1* IndsPerPop): 100000
ContDemeSizeChange=Logistic
ContLatticeSizeChange=Logistic


Dispersal model: b
Axial dispersal proba (TotalEmmigrationRate): 0.0001
Stepping stone model 
Bounds (dx_max,dy_max)=(1,0)
Marginal dispersal distribution and checksum:
0 0.9999 0.9999
1 0.0001 1

axial mean dispersal (within bounds): 0.0001
axial sigma2 (within bounds): 0.0001
axial kurtosis (within bounds): 9997

If kurtosis appears wrong there may be many reasons
   It may be because the dispersal distribution is not
   computed with enough precision.

D sigma2 (within bounds): 10
Neighborhood  (within bounds): 20(1D) or 62.8319 (2D).
expected slope (within bounds): 0.05(1D) or 0.0159155 (2D).
