I am using [IBDsim](http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/software/ibdsim/) for the simulations.\r\n\r\n#####9/5/16\r\nTo start with, the idea is to simulate a \"coastline\" of 100 demes, with sampling occurring every 10 demes of 10,000 effective individuals. 10,000 generations ago, the species existed in a restricted range of 10 demes each with 1000 individuals before expanding to present size with logistic expansion (r = 0.3; Jensen et al 2012).  Dispersal for each generation occurs with a zeta distribution (the discrete version of a pareto distribution) where the probability of moving k steps is $$ f(x) = M / k^n $$ where M is the proportion of emigrants (I have a 2 year generation time, with adults reproducing, so 0.5 individuals creating gametes = M) and n is the zeta shape parameter (higher values means tigher distribution and less kurtosis). \r\n\r\nI am also going to try a variety of markers, including mtDNA, msats and SNPS.  Tonight I simulated two datasets with these parameters, one with msats and one for mtDNA. The SNP simulation didn't work, possibly because my computer choked when trying to simulate 5000 SNPS? It works for 99 SNPS, but not 100 or 1000.\r\n\r\nThe simulation parameters are (See simul_pars file in each simulation folder):\r\n  * Zeta dispersal distribution over 100x1 matrix(shape=2, emmigration rate =0.5) Ne of each deme is 10,000; logistic growth from 10x1 matrix, each with Ne=1000 started 10,000 generations ago. Sampled 20 individuals every 10 demes, starting at deme 5. \r\n  * Single panmictic population of Ne=1,000,000; logistic growth from Ne=10,000 starting 10,000 generations ago. Sampled 200 individuals\r\n\r\nThe datasets are \r\n  * 10 microsatellites with generalized stepwise mutation and mu = 0.0005\r\n  * 1 mtDNA locus with 500 sites, HKY mutation model and mu = 0.00005 (per locus)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#####9/5/16 - 9/28/16\r\n\r\nI am running Migrate on 7 distinct models (3 separate runs of 3 replicates each). The models are:\r\n  * Panmixia\r\n  * Island model with 10 demes\r\n  * Island model with 5 demes\r\n  * Full Stepping-stone model with 10 demes\r\n  * Full Stepping-stone model with 5 demes\r\n  * 2 parameter stepping-stone model (one shared m, one shared theta) for 10 demes\r\n  * 2 parameter stepping-stone model for 5 demes\r\n\r\nRuns are being tracked on README.md\r\n\r\n",
