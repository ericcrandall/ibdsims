Random Seeds : 14071789
nbr of simulated samples : 10 dataset(s) x 10 locus = 100
generic data file name: singlepop_
Lattice with absorbing boundaries
nbr of loci per sample file (n_locus): 10
Postdisp Sample: nbr of sampled nodes (dim_sample1 X dim_sample2): 1 x 1
Postdisp sample: nbr of sampled individuals per sampled node (IndPerPopSampled): 200
Postdisp sample: x/y coordinate of "first" (bottom left) sampled node (xmin_sample/ymin_sample): 1/1

==============
Mutation model(s) (if multiple markers/loci have been specified, only the first locus of each marker is mentioned below):

GSM Mutation rate (mu) is constant for this marker : 0.0005
==============

Demographic phase: 0
At G=0 (sampling time ==  present) : 
lattice dimensions are (LatticeSizeX * LatticeSizeY): 1 x 1
Diploid individuals : nbr of genes per non empty lattice node (2 * IndsPerPop): 2000000
ContDemeSizeChange=Logistic
ContLatticeSizeChange=Logistic


Dispersal model: b
Axial dispersal proba (TotalEmmigrationRate): 0.5
Stepping stone model 
Bounds (dx_max,dy_max)=(1,0)
Marginal dispersal distribution and checksum:
0 0.5 0.5
1 0.5 1

axial mean dispersal (within bounds): 0.5
axial sigma2 (within bounds): 0.5
axial kurtosis (within bounds): -1

If kurtosis appears wrong there may be many reasons
   It may be because the dispersal distribution is not
   computed with enough precision.

D sigma2 (within bounds): 1e+06
Neighborhood  (within bounds): 2e+06(1D) or 6.28319e+06 (2D).
expected slope (within bounds): 5e-07(1D) or 1.59155e-07 (2D).
